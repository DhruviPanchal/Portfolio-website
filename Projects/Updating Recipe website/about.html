                Introducing new recipes to your weekly meal plan can liberate you from
                day-to-day mealtime monotony
                </p>

                <h3>One of the challenges of preparing nightly meals for the family is finding recipes that are both easy to make and enticing. Dinner time staples such as casseroles and pasta dishes are staples for a reason. They never fail to satisfy. Another challenge is finding ways to liven up mealtime using common ingredients found in your refrigerator and pantry. A busy life-style means there is not a lot of time to think about, let alone shop for and keep at hand exotic vegetables and spices.<br><br>

                Adding fresh recipes to the weekly meal plan does not have to be complicated. New, surprising combinations of flavors can be found in introducing your family to traditional dishes eaten by families the world over. Matched with a classic North American style desert the following three simple recipes can add variety to your weekly mealtime routine. And you might just have some tasty leftovers to throw in your lunch box for the next day.
